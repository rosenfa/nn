# Overview of Neural Network Class
Files for teaching Neural Network class 

Class 1 will focus on Variance vs. Regression, Linear Regression Batch Gradient Descent and Basic Numpy commands

Class 2 will continue and focus on Logistic Regression

Class 3 will discuss regularization methods and other gradient descent methods (SGD)

Class 4 will create basic neural networks and discuss activiation function possibilities (Sigmoid, Relu and others)

Classes 5-6 will discuss CNN and transfer learning

Class 7 will discuss autoencoders and Word2Vec

Class 8 will discuss RNN
